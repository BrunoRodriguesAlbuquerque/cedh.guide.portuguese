# What are cEDH decks like?

The [cEDH Decklist Database](https://cedh-decklist-database.com/) (or “DDB”) is
a volunteer-run compendium of hundreds of proven decks. It's a great resource
for learning what to expect from cEDH games across the world. Explore the lists,
read the primers, and find a deck you want to try out!
