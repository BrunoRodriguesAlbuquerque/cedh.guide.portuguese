Wheel effects like **Wheel of Fortune** and **Timetwister** are some of _Magic:
The Gathering_'s most powerful game pieces. They've been a staple of Commander
games played casually and competitively since the format's early days. Yet in
cEDH, do the risks of casting a wheel outweigh the benefits?

The [cedh.guide team](https://cedh.guide/team) solicited our friends
[buzz](https://twitter.com/buuuuuuuzz),
[Greg](https://twitter.com/curiouscontrol), and
[Trentyn](https://twitter.com/Trentyn907) to watch and analyze over 440 cEDH
games from four popular YouTube channels:
[Play to Win](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7339iJMCETmek3jdx9LOkg),
[Playing With Power](https://www.youtube.com/c/PlayingWithPowerMTG),
[Moderately Anonymous MTG](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModeratelyAnonymousMTG),
and [Mental Misplay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYLrJ-Qaxl2HC2pGMGAoUkg).

They asked these questions of their data: Does casting a wheel increase your
chance of winning the game? How often are wheels cast in cEDH? What difference
do payoffs like **Notion Thief** make? And just how powerful was the banned card
**Hullbreacher**?

[Ken Baumann](https://kenbaumann.com/) joined buzz, Greg, and Trentyn to discuss
their analysis of wheels in cEDH:

What do you think of wheels in cEDH? Are the risks worth the reward? Do you cast
wheels primarily to disrupt your opponents or progress your game? Are we
thinking about this all wrong? Let the
